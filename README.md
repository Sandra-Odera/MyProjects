# PROJECT 1

## Predicting Insurance Premiums

#### This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model to predict insurance premiums for individuals based on a range of personal and medical factors. The project leverages the "insurance.csv" dataset downloaded from Kaggle containing information about policyholders, including their age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and corresponding insurance premiums.
#### I performed Exploratory Data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and understand the relationships between features and insurance premiums. I then proceeded to buiid a regression model to predict the premiums.In this project, I employed Linear Regression to handle both numerical and categorical features, and assessed its performance through the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### Tools and Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
